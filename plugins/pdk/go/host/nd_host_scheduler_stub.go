// SchedulerScheduleOneTime is a stub that panics on non-WASM platforms.
// ScheduleOneTime schedules a one-time event to be triggered after the specified delay.
// Plugins that use this function must also implement the SchedulerCallback capability
//
// Parameters:
//   - delaySeconds: Number of seconds to wait before triggering the event
//   - payload: Data to be passed to the scheduled event handler
//   - scheduleID: Optional unique identifier for the scheduled job. If empty, one will be generated
//
// Returns the schedule ID that can be used to cancel the job, or an error if scheduling fails.

// SchedulerScheduleRecurring is a stub that panics on non-WASM platforms.
// ScheduleRecurring schedules a recurring event using a cron expression.
// Plugins that use this function must also implement the SchedulerCallback capability
//
// Parameters:
//   - cronExpression: Standard cron format expression (e.g., "0 0 * * *" for daily at midnight)
//   - payload: Data to be passed to each scheduled event handler invocation
//   - scheduleID: Optional unique identifier for the scheduled job. If empty, one will be generated
//
// Returns the schedule ID that can be used to cancel the job, or an error if scheduling fails.

// SchedulerCancelSchedule is a stub that panics on non-WASM platforms.
// CancelSchedule cancels a scheduled job identified by its schedule ID.
//
// This works for both one-time and recurring schedules. Once cancelled, the job will not trigger
// any future events.
//
// Returns an error if the schedule ID is not found or if cancellation fails.

	panic("host: SchedulerCancelSchedule is only available in WASM plugins")
