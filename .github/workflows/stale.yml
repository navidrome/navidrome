            This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
            recent activity. The resources of the Navidrome team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

            If this is a **bug** and you can still reproduce this error on the <code>master</code> branch, please reply with all of the information you have about it in order to keep the issue open.

            If this is a **feature request**, and you feel that it is still relevant and valuable, please tell us why.

            This issue will automatically be closed in the near future if no further activity occurs. Thank you for all your contributions.
