        "full": "<p>Schoolmates Thomas and Guy-Manuel began their career in 1992 with the indie rock trio Darlin' (named after The Beach Boys song) but were scathingly dismissed by Melody Maker magazine as \"daft punk.\" Turning to house-inspired electronica, they used the put down as a name for their DJ-ing partnership and became a hugely successful and influential dance act. First major single <em>\"Da Funk\"</em> was accompanied by a Spike Jonze-directed video and more success followed with global dance floor anthem <em>\"Around the World,\" \"One More Time,\"</em> and <em>\"Harder, Faster, Better, Stronger\"</em> - which was sampled by Kanye West for his hit <em>\"Stronger.\"</em> Albums <em>Homework</em> (1997), <em>Discovery</em> (2001) and <em>Human After All</em> (2005) all made the UK Top 10 establishing a style of simple, Chicago house-inspired grooves exploding into a robotic, rave sound.</p>"
